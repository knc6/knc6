### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Kamal Choudhary is 
- a staff scientist at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), MD, USA.
- affiliate professor at the George Mason University
- adjunct professor at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://ep.jhu.edu/faculty/kamal-choudhary/)
- associate editor of the Journal Nature:NPJ Computational Materials (https://www.nature.com/npjcompumats/editors) and editorial board member of Nature:Scientific Data.
- editorial board member of Materials Today Communications, PRX Energy journals
  
My research interests are focused on atomistic materials design using classical, quantum, and machine learning methods. In particular, I have developed JARVIS database and tools (https://jarvis.nist.gov/) that hosts publicly available datasets for millions of material properties.
