### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kamal Choudhary. I am a research scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Maryland, USA.

My research interests are focused on atomistic materials design using classical, quantum, and machine learning methods. In particular, I have developed JARVIS database and tools (https://jarvis.nist.gov/) that hosts publicly available datasets for millions of material properties.
