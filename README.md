### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Kamal Choudhary is 
- a staff scientist at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), MD, USA.
- an ssociate editor of the Journal Nature:NPJ Computational Materials (https://www.nature.com/npjcompumats/editors) and editorial board member of Materials Today Communications and Nature:Scientific Data.
- the CEO and founder of a small business DeepMaterials LLC (https://www.deepmaterials.org/)
  
My research interests are focused on atomistic materials design using classical, quantum, and machine learning methods. In particular, I have developed JARVIS database and tools (https://jarvis.nist.gov/) that hosts publicly available datasets for millions of material properties.
